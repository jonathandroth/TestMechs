Title: Bounds on direct effects for always-takers/never-takers
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Soonwoo Kwon, Jonathan Roth
Maintainer: Jonathan Roth <jonathan_roth@brown.edu>
Description: Provides tests for the "sharp null of full mediation" that a treatment D operates on an outcome Y only through a mediator (or set of mediators) M. Also provides lower bounds on the extent to which this null is violated, e.g. lower bounds on the fraction of "always-takers" who are affected by the treatment despite having no change in M.
